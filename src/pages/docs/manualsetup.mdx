```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/roboreactor/genflow-mini
```

3. Copy the `data_token_secret_key.json` into your SBC `./genflow-mini` folder with [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)
4. Remote SSH into the SBC and run the following command to install genflow mini and wait until installation complete

> ðŸ’¡ this step might take up to 10 hours

```
cd ~/genflow-mini
bash installer.sh
```
